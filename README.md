# ⚡️ Instagram Clone v1.00
Clone of Instagram using MERN stack. 

This is my first personal MERN project to put the knowledge learned into practice.

For the Back-end I have used the Node.js framework with MongoDB as the database (NoSQL). Added to this is an authentication system through the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

For the Front-end I have created a React project with "create-react-app".

For more information about the packages used, see the "package.json" file in each folder respectively.
